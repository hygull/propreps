The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
location listed above.

### DESCRIPTION
This module implements specialized container datatypes providing
alternatives to Python's general purpose built-in containers, dict,
list, set, and tuple.

* namedtuple   factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
* deque        list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end
* ChainMap     dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings
* Counter      dict subclass for counting hashable objects
* OrderedDict  dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added
* defaultdict  dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
* UserDict     wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing
* UserList     wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing
* UserString   wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing


### `namedtuple`
Help on function namedtuple in module collections:

```shell
namedtuple(typename, field_names, *, verbose=False, rename=False, module=None)
    Returns a new subclass of tuple with named fields.
```

```shell
>>> Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
>>> Point.__doc__                   # docstring for the new class
'Point(x, y)'
>>> p = Point(11, y=22)             # instantiate with positional args or keywords
>>> p[0] + p[1]                     # indexable like a plain tuple
33
>>> x, y = p                        # unpack like a regular tuple
>>> x, y
(11, 22)
>>> p.x + p.y                       # fields also accessible by name
33
>>> d = p._asdict()                 # convert to a dictionary
>>> d['x']
11
>>> Point(**d)                      # convert from a dictionary
Point(x=11, y=22)
>>> p._replace(x=100)               # _replace() is like str.replace() but targets named fields
Point(x=100, y=22)
```
